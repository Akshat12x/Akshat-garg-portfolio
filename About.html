            Hello Everyone! <br>I'm Akshat garg. This is my Portfolio where you can directly interact with me through different <b>social media</b> platforms. I'm here to help you. <br>
            I'm currently pursuing B.Tech from Quantum University, Roorkee.
            <br>
            My personal philosophy when it comes to education and learning is closely related to several cognitive theories of motivation. <br> I believe that what goes on the classroom is my responsibility and by working with students all of us can create an ideal environment for education safety understanding and even fun .
